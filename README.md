# Election Results Backend

## Project Overview

### Title
Election Results Backend

### Description
The Election Results Backend is a FastAPI-based service designed to manage and serve electoral data. This backend handles CRUD operations, data processing, and serves API endpoints for the frontend. The backend is containerized using Docker and communicates with a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.70.0
- **Web Server**: Uvicorn 0.15.0
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 1.4.25

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** (driver: psycopg2 2.9.9)

### CI/CD Tools
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Docker Compose** for multi-container orchestration

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9** or higher
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **PostgreSQL** (if running without Docker)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PranavMS007/election-results-backend.git
   cd election-results-backend
   ```

2. **Set up Python virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost/election_db
   ```

5. **Database Setup**:
   - If running locally, ensure PostgreSQL is installed and configured.
   - Run the SQL script to set up the database:
     ```bash
     psql -U postgres -d election_db -f constituency_results.sql
     ```

### Running the Application

1. **Using Docker**:
   - Start the application using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up --build
     ```
   - This will start both the FastAPI server and the PostgreSQL database.

2. **Without Docker**:
   - Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload
     ```
   - Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage Instructions

### How to Use the Application
- **API Endpoints**: Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for the automatically generated Swagger UI with documentation for all available API endpoints.
- **CSV Upload**: Use the provided endpoint to upload election results via the `file-to-upload.csv`.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Unfinished Features**: Some advanced features like detailed error handling, user authentication, and scalability optimizations are still in progress.
- **Bugs**: No significant bugs are known at the time of writing.

## Future Improvements

### To-Do List
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add detailed logging and monitoring.
- Improve error handling, especially for file uploads.
- Optimize database queries for better performance.

### Scalability Considerations
- Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
- Use load balancers and horizontal scaling for the FastAPI service.

## Time Spent and Experience

### Time Spent
Approximately **20 hours**.

### Experience
- Familiar with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Docker.
- First time integrating FastAPI with Docker and setting up CI/CD pipelines.
- Gained experience in deploying containerized applications using Docker Compose.
- Learned more about efficient CSV processing
